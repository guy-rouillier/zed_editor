Zed - text/programmer's editor.

REQUIREMENTS
************
 - You have to use gnu gcc, gnu make and gnu install.

BUILDING
********
 - Edit Makefile to select your system optimizations&simila
 - "make"
 - now you have two executables: "zed" for terminal mode, "zedx" for X11 mode.

INSTALL
*******
 - "make -n install" to see what it'll do
 - "make install" if you like it :)

 - if you want to customize configurations, copy the config files in your home
   directory as .zedrc and .zedxrc; if zed'll found error(s) in they,
   it'll revert to the copy in /etc or /usr/local/etc.
 - the default configuration for zed (cfg/zedrc, terminal mode) works with
   LINUX in a LOCAL console and use a trick to retrieve shift status throw
   linux's kernel. If this isn't your case, use the reduced version of
   the configuration file (cfg/zedrc.xterm) or use X11 version (zedx).
   Using the reduced version you'll loose some nice things, like mark a block
   with shift-arrow, but it'll work in every ansi/vt100 terminal.
 - you can configure almost ALL, please read zed.doc.

VERY FAST DEMO
**************
 - look at zed.png

MAJOR FEATURES
**************

 - Can use ANY keysequence (e.g. define a block with shift-arrow)
   even under unix local text terminal (linux).
 - intelligent screen update (NOT using the slow (n)curses).
 - Column blocks with insert & overwrite.
 - multi window/multi buffer.
 - color c++, html, tex, java, mail file.
 - shows parenthesis matching, searches for C functions, reindents C blocks.
 - about 200 commands and 100 variables to deal with.
 - Can edit/insert control codes (ascii 0-31 and 128-159).
 - executes programs with output redirected on a window (i.e. make, man, etc...).
 - Can load files with CRLF and/or CR and/or LF end-of-line marker.
 - clipboard and delete buffer.
 - savable run-time macros.
 - simple and powerful configuration system.
 - easy document mode, almost ascii.
 - automatic wordwrap and reformat, even inside quoted line within a e-mail file.
 - small, fast, powerful, low cpu consumer.
 - hexdump-like mode to edit binary file.
 - You can go everywhere with the cursor
 - Internal, fast file selector.
 - all that you'll find.

 - I'm working in a new version of zed, with many improvements,
    but I don't know when I'll release it.
